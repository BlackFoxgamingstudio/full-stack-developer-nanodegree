# Project 6 - Neighborhood Map

## About
I have developed a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. I have added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. I have researched and implemented third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
