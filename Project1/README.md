# Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website

## About
I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
I serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

## How to run
To run the script, clone this repository directory and run entertainment_center.py. You can view the page by opening fresh_tomatoes.html.
